Let's Get Physible!

This is the code for the physible.nft website. This website has been deployed on an Unstoppable Domain named - physible.nft, and is currently hosted on IPFS using Pinata.

Physible.NFT collaborates with interesting NFT projects to convert their NFTs/Game Characters/metaverse object into a physical reality, something that can be held in your hands, using the power of 3D Printing.

There are three steps to this process:

1. Identify the objects to be 'pulled into reality'.
2. Create a 3D model of the object(s) using 3D software like Blender/OnShape.
3. Print using Polymer/Resin based 3D Printers.
